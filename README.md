# A-B-test

## Maximum bidding vs. average bidding

Facebook recently introduced a new type of bid, average bidding, as an alternative to the current type of bidding called maximum bidding.

One of our customers decided to test this new feature and wants to do an A/B test to see if average bidding converts more than maximum bidding.
